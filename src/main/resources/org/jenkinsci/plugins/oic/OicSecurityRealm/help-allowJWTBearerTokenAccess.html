    Enabling this functionality allows JWT Bearer Token based access even if the associated user has
    completly logged out from Jenkins. The Bearer Token can be obtained by whatever means necessary from the IdP as long as it fulfills the following criteria:

    <ul>
		<li>The Bearer Token needs to be a JWT access token</li>
		<li>The issuer claim (iss) needs to match the issuer configured above, either manually or by .well-known discovery</li>
		<li>The token needs be signed by the IdP</li>
		<li>If token expiration has not been disabled, the token needs to be valid regarding the not-before (nbf) and expiration (exp) claims</li>
		<li>The token needs to contain the claim configured above containing the username. Usually this is the subject claim (sub)</li>
		<li>The token needs to contain the claim configured above containing the groups, otherwise the user will only be "authenticated"</li>
	</ul>

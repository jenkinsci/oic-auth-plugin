    Not required. If the field exists in the token and is an array of strings, then each string is added as a group.
    This allows groups based authorization in Jenkins. The SSO server will need to add the field with the list of groups in 
    the token. For example in Keycloak, this can be done with a 'Group Membership' mapper in the configuration of the client.

    If the SSO server adds the groups as an array of maps instead, then also use the Nested Group Name field below to specify
    which element of the map is the group name.

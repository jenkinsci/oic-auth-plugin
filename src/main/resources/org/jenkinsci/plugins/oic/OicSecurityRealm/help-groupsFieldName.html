<div>
    Not required. The field specification must be a valid <a href="https://jmespath.org/" target="_blank">JMES Path</a>.

    If the field exists in the token and is an array of strings, then each string is added as a group.
    This allows groups based authorization in Jenkins. The SSO server will need to add the field with the list of groups in 
    the token. For example in Keycloak, this can be done with a 'Group Membership' mapper in the configuration of the client.

    But if, by example, the SSO server adds the groups as an array of maps instead, then specify the group field as "groups[].name" where "groups"
    is the field containing the array of maps, and "name" it the name of the key in the map that holds the group name.

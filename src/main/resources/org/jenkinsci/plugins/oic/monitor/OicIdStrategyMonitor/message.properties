blurb=\
  <p>The Openid Connect Security Realm was configured before the introduction of the "Username case sensitivity" and "Group name case sensitivity" options.</p> \
  <p>As a result, the current configuration treats these values as case-insensitive, whereas the default for new configurations is case-sensitive.</p> \
  <p>This difference could introduce a security vulnerability depending on your specific use case. For further information, refer to the <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2025-01-22/#SECURITY-3461">security advisory</a>. Please review and select the appropriate case sensitivity settings for your environment, then save the updated security realm configuration.</p> \
  <p>Warning: Switching from case-insensitive to case-sensitive behavior can be a lossy operation if there are mixed-case usernames or group names. Users with externally-defined mixed-case names will effectively be treated as new users they next time they log in, and will lose their existing user preferences. Group-related configurations in Jenkins for externally-defined groups with mixed case names will no longer apply to members of those external groups. Users with mixed-case names previously defined in groups in Jenkins will also no longer be considered members of those groups after the switch.</p>
